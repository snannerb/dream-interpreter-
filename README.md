## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** based on the provided requirements, broken into tasks and technical considerations:

---

### **Project Plan: Dream Interpreter Webpage**

#### **Tasks**
1. **Set Up HTML Structure**
   - Create a basic HTML file (`index.html`).
   - Add the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.
   - Include a `<title>` tag with "Dream Interpreter".

2. **Apply Background Color**
   - In the `<style>` section or an external CSS file, set the `background-color` of the `<body>` to grey (`#808080` or any preferred grey shade).

3. **Add Pixel-Style Font**
   - Use a pixel-style font (e.g., "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts).
   - Embed the font in the `<head>` section using Google Fonts or a similar service.
   - Apply the font to the entire page or specific elements using CSS.

4. **Add the Title**
   - Add an `<h1>` or `<header>` tag with the title "Dream Interpreter".
   - Style the title to ensure it is prominent (e.g., center alignment, larger font size).

5. **Embed the Widget Script**
   - Place the provided widget script in the `<head>` or `<body>` section:
     ```html
     <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.ai-widget.com/Scripts?version=0.2" referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></script>
     ```
   - Ensure the script is tested for correct functionality.

6. **Add Footer Link**
   - Add a `<footer>` section at the bottom of the page.
   - Insert the provided link with `target="_blank"`:
     ```html
     <a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>
     ```
   - Style the footer to ensure it is visible and aligned properly.

7. **Test and Validate**
   - Test the webpage in multiple browsers for consistency.
   - Check the background color, font, title, widget, and footer link for proper functionality and alignment.

---

### **Technical Considerations**
- **Font Selection:** Use `@import` or `<link>` to include the pixel-style font from Google Fonts or a similar service.
- **Widget Placement:** Ensure the widget script is placed in the correct section (preferably at the end of the `<body>` to avoid blocking page rendering).
- **Footer Styling:** Use CSS to style the footer (e.g., `position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%; text-align: center;` for a sticky footer).
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test the webpage across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the webpage is accessible (e.g., use semantic HTML tags, add `alt` attributes for images if used, and ensure contrast between text and background).

---

### **Deliverables**
1. An HTML file (`index.html`) with the required structure and content.
2. A CSS file (`styles.css`) with styling for background color, font, title, and footer.
3. A tested webpage with the embedded widget and functional footer link.
